# Advantages of Being an Azure Cloud Generalist

## ABSTRACT:

I've spent years immersed in learning and teaching the Microsoft Azure cloud. I love helping people to learn important cloud technologies hands-on and playing part in helping them update their I.T. skills in the ever-changing world of the Azure cloud.

In this session I will share what I've discovered about technology levers, filters, forcing factors, and what it really means to be a 'cloud expert'. Mastering these concepts will help improve your confidence and skills in the cloud.

### Speaker:
David Cobb has over two decades in I.T. in roles spanning support, software development, and systems and database administration. David turned a mid-life career crisis into an all-in dive into Microsoft Azure, following his curiosities and achieving multiple certifications in infrastructure, data & development. David lives and shares his passion for learning as a freelance Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT). David is based in Boca Raton, FL.
