Presentation on PowerShell and SQL for PASS Virtual Chapter by David Cobb

By adding PowerShell to our toolset when working with data, DBAs and developers can go beyond Management Studio and T-SQL, applying a powerful scripting language that leverages .Net objects and Windows server capabilities, enabling us to simplify management of servers and databases, automate recurring processes, and access and manipulate data. We'll discuss PowerShell basics and concepts useful for DBAs and Developers, as well as PowerShell community resources that can help you take your work with data to the next level.
