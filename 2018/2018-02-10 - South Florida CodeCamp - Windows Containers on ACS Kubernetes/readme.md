# Code and notes from presentation: Deploy Windows Containers to Kubernetes on Azure
# [South Florida Code Camp 2018 Event Site](http://www.fladotnet.com/codecamp/Home.aspx)  

Presentation is on standing up an Azure Container Services (ACS) with Kubernetes orchestrator and Windows containers.

In an hour long session on Feb 10 2018, I walk through the [ACS Kubernetes setup process](./stand-up-acs-kubernetes-cluster.ps1) using azcli and PowerShell, connect to our cluster, review the web and command line interface, and [deploy a sample windows container.](./deploy-container-to-acs-kubernetes-cluster.ps1)

I invite anyone to copy or fork the script [stand-up-acs-kubernetes-cluster.ps1](./stand-up-acs-kubernetes-cluster.ps1), modify for your use, and take on the challenge of standing up your own K8S cluster to host Windows containers in Azure!

I'm ready to help, please submit an issue to request assistance!
